We want to:
    Read the equation from a file
    Print the answer to a file
    Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division--
        On two numbers
        On a sequence of numbers
    Be able to use the previous answer in subsequent equations

    For now, we will process the equation from left to right
        Order of Operations will come later

    We're going to expect equations to be written using the following symbols:
        +  -  /  *
